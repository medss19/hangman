# Hangman Game

I created this game in grade 11 for fun.
Welcome to the Hangman game! This simple text-based Hangman game allows you to guess words and save the hangman from getting hanged. The game provides different categories of words, and you can choose to guess a letter or the entire word.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Enter your name when prompted.
3. Choose to play the game by typing 'y' or exit by typing 'n'.
4. If you choose to play:
   - You will be given a random word to guess.
   - You can guess a letter or the entire word.
   - You have a limited number of turns to guess the correct word.
   - The game will display the hangman drawings as you make incorrect guesses.
   - Successfully guess the word to save the hangman.
   - Decide whether you want to strike a new word after each round.
